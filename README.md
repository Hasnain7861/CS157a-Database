## CS157A Sec 01 Final Project
**`React.js`** **`Node.js`** **`Express.js`** **`MySQL`** **`Heroku`** <br/><br/>
A hospital database for Jahan Ghofraniha - Syntax Savants
- SQL file can be found in ./Server/hotspital.sql
- Uses React, Node + Express, and MySQL
- Database & BackendAPI is hosted on Heroku with ClearDB

NOTE: ClearDB's free plan with Heroku does not allow us to use triggers. However, we still included it in our sql file. It is simply not in our MySQL connection with heroku.
